# Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks

**Log**
* 11/07/21 Read in the inputs in Python from file and create the inputs for the C code.
* 30/07/21 Create the base C code and parallelised by OpenMP.
* 17/08/21 Rearrange the folder structure.
* 16/09/21 Implementing the PERT method for optimizing the calculations in feedforward networks.
* 29/09/21 Implementing the mutability of the weights.
* 02/10/21 Random sampling for the training set.
* 18/10/21 RAdam implementation.
* 14/11/21 Time series: Encoder-Decoder (not published yet).
* 30/12/21 Implementing multiclass and multilabel classification.
* 03/02/22 Important fixes.
* 16/02/22 BCE with logits.
* 25/03/22 Memory management correctly for minibatches, predictions for datasets without labels, saving the weights of the optimizers.
* 26/05/22 Important fixes related to integer types.

**In progress**
* 26/05/22 Most of the GPU kernels are ready (not published yet)

**TODO**
* Convolutional networks (the C code is ready, python scripts to building convnets)
* Sequential version
* Python wrappers
* Documentation webpage
* Tutorials
